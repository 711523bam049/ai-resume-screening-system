🧠 AI Resume Screening System

An AI-powered Resume Screening System that automatically analyzes resumes, extracts key information, and evaluates how well a candidate matches a given job description based on skill overlap.

This project demonstrates a full-stack application using FastAPI for the backend and React (Vite) for the frontend, focusing on real-world resume processing and scoring logic.

	•	Comparing resume skills with job-required skills
	•	Generating a resume match score
	•	Providing results through a clean API and frontend interface

The system is designed to be fast, modular, and scalable, making it suitable for real-world HR automation use cases.
